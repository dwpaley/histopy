-put the commands for the full range in a list
-start from line 0. 
    -try exec(line). 
        -except syntaxerror unexpected EOF, get the next line and
            exec(line+next_line). (Maybe do this recursively?)
        -except something else:
            -catch error and stack trace
            -print those like normal
            -prompt "continue executing at line ... or break?"
